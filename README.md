# Intrusion-Detection-System-KDD-Cup-99-Bi-LSTM
IDS using the KDD Cup 99' dataset
<br>
This is a experimental project to implement intrusion Detection Systems. With the cumulation of an intrusion detection system and SNORT as a backend application, We compare the real time efficiency of each method.
<br>
This is currently in progress so I will be updating this repo. ;) Hope we can learn this together
