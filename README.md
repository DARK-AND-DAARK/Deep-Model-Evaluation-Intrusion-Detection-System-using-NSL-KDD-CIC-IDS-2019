# Deep Model Intrusion Detection Evaluation using NSL KDD and CIC IDS 2018
IDS using the NSL KDD and CIC IDS 2019
<br>
This is a experimental project to implement intrusion Detection Systems. With the cumulation of an intrusion detection system and SNORT as a primitive inspiration, We compare the real time efficiency of each method.
<br>
This is currently in progress so I will be updating this repo. ;) Hope we can learn this together
