# Deep Model Intrusion Detection Evaluation of NSL KDD and CIC IDS 2018 datasets and Development of SNORT GUI.
<br>
This is a research project to implement a Network Intrusion Detection Systems. With the cumulation of an intrusion detection system and SNORT as a primitive inspiration, We compare the real time efficiency of each method.
<br>

<br>**This is currently in progress so I will be updating this repo.......**</br>

# [The SNORT GUI [v1.0.0]](https://github.com/WhiteHatCyberus/Deep-Model-Evaluation-Intrusion-Detection-System-using-NSL-KDD-CIC-IDS-2018/tree/main/snort/SNORT%20GUI)
The snort main program consists of:
* A rule generation tool that makes formulating rules faster.
* Open .rules file
* Provide help centre.
``` bash
sudo python3 snortgui.py
```
